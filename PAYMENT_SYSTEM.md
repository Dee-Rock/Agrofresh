  phone_number: "0241234567",
  delivery_info: deliveryInfo
};

const result = await createPayment(paymentData);
console.log('Payment created:', result.payment_id);
```

### Tracking Payment Status
```javascript
import PaymentStatusTracker from '@/components/PaymentStatusTracker';

<PaymentStatusTracker
  paymentId={paymentId}
  amount={amount}
  onStatusChange={(status) => console.log('Status changed:', status)}
  showDetails={true}
  autoRefresh={true}
/>
```
